Hi, here you'll find an excel assignement I coded for my master's degree.
Given a dataset of market rates from different companies, all of them from the same time period, the assignement was to simulate a portfolio and to see if it'd fullfill the requirements we expected.
The program asks the user to input the portfolio's composition, the initial investment, how many days does the user want to simulate and how many simulations does he want to do.
Finally, the macro will simulate the portfolio the amount of times asked and return a plot with all the simulations.
